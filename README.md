Various small experiments with WebAssembly

The examples built with 2 different toolchains:

- [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/)
- [wasi-sdk](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk)

Even though both can be used to target web and standalone runtime environments, 
emscripten is most suitable for code that will run in a web page, while 
wasi-sdk is most suitable for code that will run standalone.
